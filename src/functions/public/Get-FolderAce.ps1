function Get-FolderAce {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Alternative to Get-Acl designed to be as lightweight and flexible as possible
        Lightweight: Does not return the Path property like Get-Acl does
        Flexible how?  Was it long paths?  DFS?  Can't remember what didn't work with Get-Acl
    .DESCRIPTION
    Returns an object for each access control entry instead of a single object for the ACL
    Excludes inherited permissions by default but allows them to be included with the -IncludeInherited switch parameter
    .INPUTS
    None. Pipeline input is not accepted.
    .OUTPUTS
    [PSCustomObject]
    .NOTES
    Currently only supports Directories but could easily be copied to support files, or Registry or AD providers
