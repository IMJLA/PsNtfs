function Get-DirectorySecurity {
    <#
    .SYNOPSIS
    Alternative to Get-Acl designed to be as lightweight and flexible as possible
        Lightweight: Does not return the Path property like Get-Acl does
        Flexible how?  Was it long paths?  DFS?  Can't remember what didn't work with Get-Acl
    .DESCRIPTION
    Returns an object for each access control entry instead of a single object for the ACL
    Excludes inherited permissions by default but allows them to be included with the -IncludeInherited switch parameter
    .INPUTS
    None. Pipeline input is not accepted.
    .OUTPUTS
    [PSCustomObject]
    .NOTES
    Currently only supports Directories but could easily be copied to support files, or Registry or AD providers

    Get-Acl would have already populated the Path property on the Access List, but [System.Security.AccessControl.DirectorySecurity] has a null Path property instead
    Creating new PSCustomObjects with all the original properties then manually setting the Path is faster than using Add-Member

    The creator of a folder is the Owner
    Unless S-1-3-4 (Owner Rights) is in the DACL, the Owner is implicitly granted two standard access rights defined in WinNT.h of the Win32 API:
      READ_CONTROL: The right to read the information in the object's security descriptor, not including the information in the system access control list (SACL).
      WRITE_DAC: The right to modify the discretionary access control list (DACL) in the object's security descriptor.

    Previously the .Owner property was already populated with the NTAccount name of the Owner,
    but for some reason this stopped being true and now I have to call the GetOwner method.
    This at least lets us specify the AccountType to match what is used when calling the GetAccessRules method.
